This program demonstrates the use of keypoint matching algorithm (like SIFT in this case) to recognize the object in the image.

"Data" directory contains some template and test images which are used for this demonstration. The algorithm is implemented in "main.m" script.

VlFeat library has been used to achieve this task. It can be downloaded from:
http://www.vlfeat.org/
or
https://github.com/vlfeat/vlfeat

Note: The script won't run without VlFeat.
